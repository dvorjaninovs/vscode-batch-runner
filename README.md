## Running batch file with arguments

VS Code can show a prompt where you can type in the arguments before executing the batch file.

Ways to run the batch file with arguments:  

* Command: *"Batch Runner: Run with Arguments"* (`batch-runner.execBatchFileArgs`)
* In the context menu when right clicking a batch file, select *"Run with Arguments"*
* By clicking the dropdown arrow next to the run button and selecting *"Run with Arguments"*

## Running batch file as administrator

Ways to run the batch file with administrator privileges:

* Command: *"Batch Runner: Run as Administrator"* (`batch-runner.execBatchFileAsAdmin`)
* Holding down <kbd>Alt</kbd> when right clicking a file in the explorer will provide you with the option to run the batch file as administrator.
* By clicking the dropdown arrow next to the run button and selecting *"Run as Administrator"*

<br>

## Diff Editor Support

When viewing a batch file in the diff editor (comparing two versions), the extension will detect which side of the diff is currently focused and run that specific file. If focus cannot be determined, it defaults to the modified (right) side of the diff.
